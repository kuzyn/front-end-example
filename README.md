#Samuel Cousin / Angular, Bootstrap

Simple Angular demo app using [Angular-Chart.js](http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/) and Bootstrap.  

You can try it out at: [http://angular.samuelcousin.com/](http://angular.samuelcousin.com/)  

You can clone it locally and test it out. To mess around the code and go wild, just:   
```
npm install  
bower install  
gulp  
```   

It's super simple & looks like:
