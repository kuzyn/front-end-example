#Samuel Cousin / Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap

1. Use the `data.json` file to create a responsive bootstrap grid with headers **city**, **start date**, **end date**, **price**, **status**, **color**.  All the Columns should be sortable.  

2. Above the grid, please add two date pickers to filter the object by date range.

3. Using [Angular-Chart.js](http://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/), create a chart using some of the properties of the data above. Here you may be as creative as you wish.
